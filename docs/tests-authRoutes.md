Test / Document all custom routes in authRoutes.ts
** Keystone database is used for this project and is rendered by mySQL 9.3.0 via DBeaver.
1. the permission configuration in the backend was improperly setup and didnâ€™t allow the front end to connect.
2. Most of the models in the backend have an 
access:
1.   This access section defines what actions are allowed for the user to take. 
2.    I manually changed all of them to just return true, giving myself 100% authority. 
3.    These access properties are meant to limit user action and must be decided carefully. 
4.    During backend testing, I determined the most restrictive access properties that still allow the front end to function as intended.

        * there is no 'access' in the index.ts file under models folder
        * Next is Testing the Routes folder



7. Under Routes, I located the authRoutes.ts file and tested two tests using GET requests on Postman:
   1. "/auth/google"
        - This functionality redirects users to Google for authentication
        - ![Description of screenshot](../test_images/auth_google.png)
   2. "/auth/google/callback"
        - This functionality serves as a callback as part of Google OAuth and if successful then it redirects user to the dashboard/home.

8. activityLogRoute.ts has a GET request to test and POST 
![Description of screenshot](../test_images/%20activityLog_code.png)
   1. "/api/projects/:projectId/activity-log"
   2. using the UI on the BE, I had to create a test under prjects to create an projectID which is 6ada6386-b955-4082-891b-f7ced2274e09
   ![Description of screenshot](../test_images/projectID_creation.png)
      1. GET response for activityLog:
        ![Description of screenshot](../test_images/get_activityLog.png)

      2. POST response for activityLog:
